My website is slowly being rebuilt whenever I find some time to waste.
I wonder who's wasting more time? Me building or you visiting.

<?_title("Stop software 'piracy', support Open Source !")?>
Is commercial software too expensive or piracy against your ethics ?
Afraid of the <?_link("http://www.bsa.org/belgium-dutch/","BSA")?>
 rightfully raiding your home or company ?  Start using Open Source
software !  For everything you do, a free ('no strings attached')
Open Source alternative exists. And you can still pay someone,
if you want to ;-)

<?/*_title("Soapbox has been released !")?>
Due to limitations to RPM, I coded a sandbox mechanism, misnamed
<?_link("/home-made/soapbox/","Soapbox")?>, to detect file-system
changes outside the buildroot. It integrates well with Dar, but can be used
seperately to test-run untrusted (dynamically linked) programs.

<?/* <?_title("My public music playlist...")?>
Thanks to <?_link("http://snackamp.sourceforge.net/","snackAmp")?>
 I now export <?_link("/personal/playlist.php","my current playlist")?>.
The remote control function is cleverly disabled so that colleagues and
friends won't mess around. (I'm sure they would want that!)

<?_title("Apt RPM repository and DAR online")?>
I made my own <?_link("/home-made/dar/","RPM build system")?> that uses clean
build environments. This allows me to easily package software for more than
one distribution/release.
More information on this repository on <?_link("/apt/","Dag Apt Repository")?>. */?>

<?_title("Looking for Linux expertise ?")?>
Maybe I can help you ! I am experienced in deploying Linux at companies
in a secure, scalable and coherent manner. Take a look at my
<?_link("/cv/","curriculum vitae")?>.
I'm always eager to learn and I don't mind working abroad.
