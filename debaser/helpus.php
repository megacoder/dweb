<p>
  I am missing quite a lot of information about the Pixies (anything really !).
  This is what I'm desperately looking for:
  <ul>
    <li> Bootlegcovers, still need 8 of the 42 ! And I probably miss lots more that I haven't heard of yet ;-(
    <ul>
      (Come On Pilgrim/Surfer Rosa Demo Tapes, Ed Is Dead, Jaap Edenhall, Planet of Sound,
       Reading festival (?), SF Warfield, The B-Side File, The Fallout Shelter)
    </ul>
    <li> Call me insane, but i would like every little word on all releases ! 
         I've got the sleeves of their normal albums, but from singles and bootlegs as well would be great ;-)
         Like <?_link("albums/death_to_the_pixies.txt","this")?> or <?_link("albums/doolittle.txt","this")?>
    <li> A lot of tabs. I'm not a musician and can't help in that area.
    <li> I got a mail from someone from the UK suggesting I put some Pixies tattoos of fans online.
         Things like that would be -bizarre- too, of course !
    <li> Great idea's, pictures, info, lots of info, data, more data, input, input, aaaaargh...
  </ul>
